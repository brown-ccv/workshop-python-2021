    "Great! Now that you have the pulled pork recipe, we want to scale it to feed all the people attending the BBQ. So far, 20 people have signed up to attend. We want to scale the recipe such that the minimum number it yields just barely exceeds the number of people that are attending. To help you out, I've created a dictionary, `recipe_num_dict`, that has a nickname for scalable entries as keys and a string that represents the values that need to be scaled as values to the dictionary. Although not all recipes' preperation and total times scale proportionally when increasing the ingredients, let's assume ours does."
