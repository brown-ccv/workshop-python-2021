INGREDIENTS (TOPPING)
6 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons your favorite bbq sauce

DIRECTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

2. Lightly butter a deep 9 by 13-inch baking dish.

3. Shred left over BBQ into fine pieces and set aside.

4. In a large bowl, stir together the butter, milk, and sugar. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, until well incorporated. Add the creamed corn, chiles, cheese, and shredded BBQ and stir until well incorporated.

5. In a separate bowl, stir together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Add flour mixture to corn mixture; stir until smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan.

6. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour 10 minutes, or until golden brown and until a toothpick inserted into center of the pan comes out clean.

7. Topping: Combine all and melt in microwave. Brush over cornbread and place back in oven for a few minutes. Cut into squares and serve warm. It's ok to break up pieces and serve in a small bowl.
