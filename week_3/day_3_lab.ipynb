    "Welcome the BBQ scavenger hunt! For the initial setup, uncompress `day_3_assets/lab.zip` at `day_3_assets/lab`. Your search will start at `day_3_assets/lab` and you will explore its sub-directories to find coins! To start your hunt, simply change directories to either `walk_north`, `walk_south`, `walk_east`, or `walk_west`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To navigate to another directory, you must read and do what the `README.txt` file states before moving further (note, not all directories have a `README.txt` file). Some files will require you to solve an exercise before advancing. To do so, simply insert your solutions below. If you navigate back to a directory where you've already solved an exercise, you don't have to solve it again. If a file tells you to roll a `n`-sided dice, use the `roll_dice(n)` function below.\n",

    "Each coin has a point value and there are a total of 30 points in this scavenger hunt. Can you find them all?\n",

    "Some additional rules:\n",
    "- you MAY use any tools you've learned so far EXCEPT:\n",
    "    - any tools to list directory trees beyond the current working directory\n",
    "    - any tools to find files outside the current working directory\n",
    "- you MAY NOT use any type of directory navigation GUIs (e.g., Finder on Mac OS or File Explorer on Windows)\n",
    "- ignore any hidden directories or files (i.e., starts with `.`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpful hints:\n",
    "- feel free to create helper functions that will assist you on your journey!\n",
    "    - e.g., you will frequently change directories, print the current directory, list files, and read text files so it might be useful to create a function that combines them as one action\n",
    "- it may be helpful to create a starting path using the `pathlib` module then create and update a seperate path variable for each direction you branch off in\n",
    "    - e.g., if `start_path = Path.cwd() / 'day_3_assets' / 'lab'` is our starting path and I want to go to `walk_north`, you could create a variable `north_path = start_path / 'walk_north'` where each time you change directories going north, you update `north_path`\n",
