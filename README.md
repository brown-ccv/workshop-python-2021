# Python Workshop, June 2021
## Intro
Welcome to 'Introduction to Python Programming and Best Practices'! The goal of this workshop is to increase data fluency of the Brown community. In the first two weeks, we learn Python basics such as variables, container types (e.g., lists and dictionaries), control flow (if statements and for loops), and functions. The third week covers a variety of smaller topics related to the standard Python library, other data formats (like JSON), and how to interact with the operating system via Python. Finally, we will learn how to work with and visualize tabular data (excel, csv, SQL data) using packages like pandas and matplotlib during the last week.

## Tools
We provide an yaml file which you can use with conda to recreate the python environemt of the workshop. Please install conda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), and type the following commands into your terminal at the same folder where the workshop material is located:

*conda env create -n workshop_env -f workshop-python-2021/workshop.yml*

*conda activate workshop_env*

Alternatively, you can also use the jupyter hub to run the materials. Click on [http://ccv.jupyter.brown.edu/](http://ccv.jupyter.brown.edu/) and log in with your Brown ID. Once the jupyter-lab starts (it could take a couple of minutes), click on the 'Git Clone' button on the left side and copy the URL of this repo in there. Once the cloning is completed, you should see the week 1-4 folders and the ipython notebooks.
